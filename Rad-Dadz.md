# Rad-Dadz.com: Jorts for Everyone!

## Rad-Dadz is the internet's primary resource for Dads vainly trying to remain cool.

At Rad-Dadz we understand the existential angst of "cool" passing you by. We provide an online location you can visit to interact with others like yourself: people who get what's _actually_ cool. Yep, we're talking comfortable sweatpants, jorts, socks with sandals, and simple groan-inducing puns.

We also provide youth-translation services, including acronyms and emoji!

>I tried to get my daughter to explain what ~~the fuck~~ Pokemon Go is, didn't understand a word of it. Then I hopped on Rad-Dadz and learned the excellent side-splitter "Don't you mean poke mango?" and I was able to successfully impress my daughter's friends while driving them to the cinema.
