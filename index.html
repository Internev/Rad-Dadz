				At Rad-Dadz we understand the existential angst of "cool" passing you by. We provide an online location you can visit to interact with others like yourself: people who get what's <em>actually</em> cool. Yep, we're talking comfortable sweatpants, jorts,
				socks with sandals, and simple groan-inducing puns.
			</p>
			<p class="bigger">
				We also provide youth-translation services, including acronyms and emoji!

				I tried to get my daughter to explain what <s>the fuck</s> Pokemon Go is, didn't understand a word of it. Then I hopped on Rad-Dadz and learned the excellent side-splitter "I'd rather poke a mango than a Pokemon Go!" and I was able to successfully
				impress my daughter's friends while driving them to the cinema.
