				<h4>Russ <em>"Straight-Shooter"</em> Chunkless</h4>
				<p>
					Russ is the editor-in-chief of Rad Dadz, and everyone here agrees that he "lives it". A strong advocate for the mobile phone holster, sunglass-straps, bum-bags and other extremely sensible and useful accoutrements (some found in our <a href='#'>store!</a>).
					Russ loves nothing more than yardwork, and complaining about yardwork.

				<h4>Patrick <em>"Pattycakes"</em> Flubwernder</h4>

				<p>
					The maker: Patrick relishes the chance to create a useless knick-knack out of an otherwise useful materials. Oft found in his "workshop" - a corner of the laundry his wife lets him use - Pattycakes delights in home repair, and later talking to the professionals
					hired by his wife to fix his home repairs.
